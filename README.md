# Equitable Access to Bike-Sharing Services
## CSC-555 || Social Computing and Decentralized AI || Fall-23

### Introduction
Bikesharing is a very relevant problem, typically in places such as Washington, NY, etc, where biking, as a mode of greener transportation, is catching on with fervor. In our study, we aim to predict the best possible allocation of resources within a particular instance, that would yield the best output in terms of fuel consumption and footfall traffic.

We aim to develop a multi-objective agent application that can accept various parameters with regards to the station traffic, charge or fuel consumption, distance from one another, etc and model the most efficient solution for the given landscape.  

We use the bikesharing dataset, as the source of information regarding stations placed around New York City. We use the Binary Quadratic model, to use the quantum techniques of binary offsetting in the quadratic formula and produce the most efficient energy state. The energy state, in turn, optimizes on all the paramemeters of distance, traffic and fuel and produces the most efficient intersection or set, that satisfies them. 

We repeat this for several runs, taking out the optimal points and searching for optimality in a reduced search space, repeatedly, till the points reach a certain threshold (about 10 stations).

### Instructions to Execute the Program
<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>
To clone our repository, use 
    
``` git-clone https://github.com/SN-18/CSC-555-Project-asfirodi-snanda2-mshenke.git```
  </li>
  <li>
   From a terminal based environment,install the requirements and essential packages, run:

   ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt ```
  </li>

  <li>
  If your local system has no IDE present, there are a lot of free IDE's available online, such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/). More information can be found at: [Free IDEs](https://www.goodfirms.co/integrated-development-environment-software/blog/best-free-and-open-source-integrated-development-environment-software)
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the command,
  
  ``` python main.py ```
    
    
     
  </li>
</ol>



### Debugging Instructions
There can be many issues that are causing your program to throw an error or raise an exception. Some of the most common problems are:
<ul>

  <li>
  Please Check for the version of Python you are currently using. This can be performed using:
 
  ``` python --version ```
    
<br>
It should have an output similar to the following screen:

![Python version](https://github.com/SN-18/CSC-555-Project-asfirodi-snanda2-mshenke/assets/83748468/e4d54136-e98f-4533-a2b4-057d4b1c945c)

  If python is not found, it can be installed using:

  ``` pip install python ```
  <br>
  
  or using the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Please check if the requirements are satisfied using the command:

  ``` pip list```

  <br>
  The following is the expected output for the above. 
  <br><br><br>

 <br><br>
  
  <br> It should, in theory, contain all the packages listed in the requirements.txt. If not, any individual package can be installed using:

  ``` pip install <package_name>```
<br>

from the terminal.
  
 </li>
</ul>



### Final Output
The final output should select the maximum energy, and give the combination of nodes or stations that should be selected at the same time (active at the same time of the day), to get maximum efficiency. The output would look something like this:

The first set of lines denote the data structure holding the set of stations picked. The value of "1" denotes having been chosen, or a spin of '1' if we view it in terms of an energy model. The last line denotes the maximum energy generated by choosing the given set of nodes or stations.
